/**
 * Native PHP sessions for an application-server worker.
 *
 * A worker is not a SAPI, so the session half of what PHP normally does for an
 * application is missing. Under `php-cgi`/FPM the session is started from the
 * request's `Cookie` header and the cookie naming it is written into the
 * response headers; over a worker's pipe neither happens, so a long-lived
 * process with flash messages, logins or CSRF tokens silently loses its session
 * state between requests.
 *
 * Both halves are done here. The id is taken from the request's cookies before
 * the application runs, and the `Set-Cookie` for a session started during the
 * request is produced for the adapter to put on the response. The adapter owns
 * the transport — a PSR-7 header bag, a protocol frame — so this class never
 * touches the response itself.
 *
 * This is a *worker* class. Under a normal SAPI, `session_start()` already does
 * all of this and the class is unnecessary.

     * Stop PHP from trying to deliver the session cookie itself.
     *
     * A worker's SAPI cannot deliver headers: `header()`, `setcookie()` and
     * `headers_list()` are all no-ops, so a `Set-Cookie` PHP writes would never
     * reach the client, and `session_start()` would waste work building it. The
     * adapter carries the cookie out instead, and this stops PHP from trying.
     *
     * Two settings, for two reasons:
     *
     * - `session.use_cookies=0` is what makes PHP skip both the cookie it cannot
     *   send and the session id it would otherwise only accept from that cookie.
     *   An id the client *did* send is still adopted — `session_id()` is set
     *   explicitly — so a returning client keeps its session.
     * - `session.cache_limiter=''` silences the `nocache` limiter, which exists
     *   only to emit `Cache-Control` headers through the same dead channel. PHP
     *   also raises a warning when it cannot send them, and a warning on the way
     *   out is noise in a worker's log.
     *
     * Both are best-effort. `ini_set()` cannot change a session setting while a
     * session is active, so a caller that started one earlier keeps its own
     * configuration — as it does under FPM, where PHP's cookie handling is
     * correct and this class is not needed at all.
     *
     * The reason this is safe to do here and not a second source of truth: the
     * adapter always emits the cookie itself, exactly when an id was created
     * that the client did not present. PHP, with cookies on, would emit one in
     * the same circumstances — so the two agree rather than overlap.
